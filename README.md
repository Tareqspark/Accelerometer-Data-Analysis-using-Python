# Accelerometer-Data-Analysis-using-Python
The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring.
For the task of Accelerometer Data Analysis, we first need to collect data collected by an accelerometer. As an accelerometer collects three-dimensional data, itâ€™s essential to have data about the x, y, and z axes in our dataset with respect to a particular time.
